        </header>
        <p>Linked Lists, according to geeksforgeeks.org, are data structures in which elements are organized 
        in a linear fashion and connected to eachother via pointers.</p>
        
        <p>Each <b class = "a">element</b> is made of two parts. The first is the actual data being stored, and the second is a pointer to the next node.</p>
        
        <p>Linked Lists make use of unique methods. Linked Lists are often compared with dynamic arrays; each 
        has it's own set of advantages and disadvantages.</p>
